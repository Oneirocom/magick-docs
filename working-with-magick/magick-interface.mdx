The Magick Interface is the central hub for creating, managing, and deploying AI agents. It provides a user-friendly and intuitive interface to design and develop agent logic using a visual programming approach.

## Navigation

The Magick Interface consists of several key areas and components that you can navigate through to access different functionalities:

### Sidebar (1, 2, 3)

The sidebar on the left side of the interface contains the following sections:

- **Agent Selector (1)**: Allows you to switch between different agents you have access to.

### Tab Bar (4)

The tab bar at the top of the interface shows the currently open tabs, such as the Spell Editor, Knowledge, Config, Secrets, and Events. You can switch between these tabs to access different settings and functionalities for your agent.

- **Logs Panel (17)**: Displays logs, errors, and debugging information generated during the execution of your agent. Here you can filter out different types of logs as well as toggle auto scrolling the output.

## Creating and Managing Agents

{/* To create a new agent, click on the "Create Agent" button in the Agent Selector (1). You can then provide a name and description for your agent.

To switch between different agents, simply click on the desired agent in the Agent Selector (1). */}

## Developing Agent Logic

The main area for developing your agent's logic is the Editor Canvas(11). Here, you can visually construct your agent's spell behavior using nodes and connections.

To add a new node to your spell, right-click on the canvas to open the Node Picker, then search for and select the desired node. Drag and drop the node onto the canvas.

To connect nodes, click and drag from the output socket of one node to the input socket of another node. This establishes the flow of data and control between the nodes.

Use the Properties Panel (7) to configure the properties and settings for various node in your spell.

## Testing and Debugging

The Play Test Panel (9) allows you to test your agent's behavior by simulating a conversation or interaction. Enter messages or triggers and observe how your agent responds based on its current logic.

The Logs Panel (17) provides valuable information for debugging and troubleshooting your agent. It displays logs, errors, and other relevant details generated during the execution of your spell.

## Deploying Agents

Once you have developed and tested your spell on your draft Agent, you can publish those changes to your Live Agent. This allows you to develop your spell without affecting your users. When you click the "Publish to Agent" button, a new version of your spell is created and deployed to your Live Agent.

Magick handles the deployment and scaling of your agent automatically, ensuring reliable and efficient operation.
