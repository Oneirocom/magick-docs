The nodes are the building blocks of your agent's logic. Each node represents a specific action, decision, or data transformation within your spell. You can connect nodes together to create a flow of operations that define your agent's behavior.

# Output Sockets
Output sockets are the connection points on nodes where data or control flow is passed to subsequent nodes. By linking output sockets to input sockets, you define the sequence of operations and data flow within your agent.

# Input Sockets
Input sockets are the connection points on nodes where data or control flow is received from preceding nodes. By linking input sockets to output sockets, you establish the flow of information and actions within your agent.
