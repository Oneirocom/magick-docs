# Now

The Now node retrieves the current Unix timestamp, which is the number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1, 1970 (midnight UTC/GMT). This node is useful when you need to work with the current time in your spells.

## Inputs

This node does not have any inputs.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The current Unix timestamp as a floating-point number.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Now node, simply add it to your spell. It will output the current Unix timestamp whenever the spell is run.

### Example

Here's an example of how you might use the Now node in a spell:

1. Add a Now node to your spell.
2. Connect the `result` output of the Now node to the input of another node that requires a timestamp, such as a node that formats the timestamp into a human-readable date and time.

A[Now] --> B[Format Timestamp]
B --> C[Display Text]
```

In this example, the Now node provides the current timestamp to a Format Timestamp node, which converts it into a readable date and time string. The formatted string is then displayed using a Display Text node.

## Best Practices

- Use the Now node whenever you need the current time in your spell, such as for logging, data analysis, or creating time-based triggers.
- Keep in mind that the Unix timestamp is always in UTC/GMT. If you need to display the time in a different time zone, you'll need to use additional nodes to handle the time zone conversion.

## Common Issues

There are no common issues or gotchas to watch out for with the Now node, as it simply retrieves the current timestamp without any additional configuration or dependencies.

By using the Now node, you can easily incorporate the current time into your Magick spells, enabling a wide range of time-based functionality and analysis.
