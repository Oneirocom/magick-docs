# Log Array

The Log Array node allows you to log an array of data to the console for debugging purposes. It's a useful tool for inspecting the contents of an array at any point in your spell's execution.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The input flow that triggers the node to execute.
- `text` (optional): A custom message to include in the log output. Defaults to an empty string.
- `severity` (optional): The severity level of the log message. Can be "info", "warning", or "error". Defaults to "info".
- `payload` (required): The array of data to log to the console.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The output flow after the array has been logged.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the input flow to the `flow` input port. This determines when the node will execute.
2. (Optional) Provide a custom message to the `text` input to add context to the log output.
3. (Optional) Set the `severity` input to "info", "warning", or "error" to indicate the importance of the log message. 
4. Connect the array you want to log to the `payload` input port.
5. Connect the `flow` output port to the next node in your spell.

When the spell is run, the Log Array node will output the contents of the specified array to the console, along with the custom message and severity level.

## Example

Here's an example of how you might use the Log Array node in a spell:

```
1. HTTP Request
   URL: https://api.example.com/data
   
2. JSON Parse
   JSON String: [Data from HTTP Request]

3. Log Array
   Text: "Received data from API"
   Severity: info
   Payload: [Parsed JSON array]
   
4. Filter Array
   Array: [Logged array]
   Condition: item.value > 10
   
5. Log Array  
   Text: "Filtered data"
   Payload: [Filtered array]
```

In this example, we make an HTTP request to an API endpoint, parse the JSON response into an array, and log that array with the message "Received data from API". 

We then filter the array to only include items where the `value` property is greater than 10, and log the filtered array with the message "Filtered data".

By strategically placing Log Array nodes, we can inspect the data at different stages of processing and ensure the spell is working as expected.

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive messages in the `text` input to make it easier to understand the purpose of each log statement.
- Set the `severity` input to "warning" or "error" for logs that indicate potential problems.
- Remove or disable Log Array nodes before deploying your spell to production to avoid cluttering the console.

## Common Issues

- Forgetting to connect the `payload` input will result in an empty array being logged.
- Logging very large arrays can make the console output difficult to read. Consider filtering or limiting the data before logging if needed.
