# On Discord Reaction Add

The On Discord Reaction Add node is an event node that triggers when a reaction is added to a message in a Discord channel. It allows you to capture and respond to user reactions in real-time.

## Inputs

This node does not have any input ports.

## Outputs

- `flow`: Sends a flow signal to the next node in the spell when a reaction is added.
- `reaction`: The emoji or custom emoji that was added as a reaction to the message.
- `count`: The total number of reactions of this emoji on the message.
- `messageId`: The unique ID of the message that the reaction was added to.
- `event`: The raw event data from the Discord API, which contains additional details about the reaction event.

## Configuration

- `hiddenProperties` (advanced): An array of properties to hide from the node's configuration panel. Defaults to `["hiddenProperties", "eventState"]`.
- `eventState` (advanced): An array used internally by the node to manage its state. Defaults to an empty array.
- `eventStateProperties` (advanced): An array of properties to include in the node's event state. Defaults to `["connector", "client", "channel", "agentId", "sender"]`.

## Usage

1. Add an On Discord Reaction Add node to your spell.
2. Connect the node's `flow` output to the input of the next node(s) you want to trigger when a reaction is added.
3. Use the `reaction`, `count`, `messageId`, and `event` outputs to access data about the reaction event and perform additional actions or logic.

## Example

Here's an example of how you might use the On Discord Reaction Add node in a spell:

```
Discord Connector
|
On Discord Reaction Add
|
If Reaction Equals 👍
|       |
|       Send Discord Message ("Thanks for the thumbs up!")
|
If Reaction Equals 👎
|       |
|       Send Discord Message ("Sorry you didn't like it.")
|
If Reaction Equals 🚀
        |
        Increment Rocket Counter
        |
        Update Channel Topic
```

In this example, the spell listens for reactions added to messages in a Discord channel. When a 👍 reaction is added, it sends a "Thanks for the thumbs up!" message. When a 👎 reaction is added, it sends a "Sorry you didn't like it." message. When a 🚀 reaction is added, it increments a rocket counter and updates the channel topic to display the current count.

## Best Practices

- Use the `reaction` output to check for specific emojis and trigger different actions based on the reaction.
- Combine the On Discord Reaction Add node with other Discord nodes like Send Discord Message or Update Discord Channel to create interactive experiences.
- Be mindful of the rate limits and usage restrictions of the Discord API to avoid hitting limits or getting your bot flagged.

## Common Issues

- Make sure your Discord bot has the necessary permissions to read message reactions in the channels you want to monitor.
- Note that the `event` output provides the raw event data, which may change if Discord updates their API. Use the `reaction`, `count`, and `messageId` outputs for more stable access to key event properties.
