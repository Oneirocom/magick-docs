# Send Discord Message

The Send Discord Message node allows you to send a message to a specified channel in Discord from your Magick spell. This is useful for sending notifications, alerts, or any other information from your spell to a Discord server.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The flow from the previous node in the spell.
- `content` (required): The text content of the message to send to Discord. This can include plain text, emoji, and basic markdown formatting.
- `channel` (required): The ID of the Discord channel to send the message to. This should be a string in the format `CHANNEL_ID`.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The flow continues to the next node in the spell after the message is sent.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add the Send Discord Message node to your spell.
2. Connect the `flow` input to the output of the previous node in your spell.
3. Set the `content` input to the text you want to include in your Discord message. You can include emoji and basic markdown formatting.
4. Set the `channel` input to the ID of the Discord channel where you want to send the message. You can find the channel ID by right-clicking the channel in Discord and selecting "Copy ID".
5. Connect the `flow` output to the next node in your spell, if applicable.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Send Discord Message node in a spell:

1. Use a Trigger node to start the spell, such as a Schedule trigger to run the spell daily.
2. Use a HTTP Request node to fetch some data from an API.
3. Use a Transform Data node to extract the relevant information from the API response.
4. Use the Send Discord Message node to send a summary of the extracted data to a Discord channel.
   - Set `content` to a string that includes the summary information, e.g. "Daily update: There were 25 new signups today!"
   - Set `channel` to the ID of your "daily-updates" Discord channel.
5. Use a Debug node to log a message indicating the spell ran successfully.

## Best Practices

- Be mindful of the content you send to public Discord channels. Avoid sending sensitive information.
- Use clear and concise language in your messages to make them easy for your audience to understand.
- Take advantage of Discord's formatting options to make your messages more readable and visually appealing.
- If sending messages to a busy channel, consider using Discord threads to keep conversations organized.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure you have the correct channel ID specified in the `channel` input. An incorrect ID will cause the message to fail to send.
- Check that your Magick app has the necessary permissions in your Discord server to send messages to the specified channel.
- If your message content includes special characters, make sure they are properly escaped to avoid formatting issues.
