# DoOnce

The DoOnce node is a flow control node that allows a portion of a spell to be executed only once, even if the node receives multiple triggers. It is useful for initializing variables, setting up one-time configurations, or performing actions that should only happen a single time regardless of how many times the spell is run.

## Inputs

- `flow` (flow): The main flow input that triggers the node's execution.
- `reset` (flow): An optional flow input that, when triggered, resets the DoOnce node, allowing the main flow to be executed again the next time it is triggered.

## Outputs

- `flow` (flow): The flow output that is triggered only once when the main `flow` input is triggered, unless the node is reset.

## Configuration

The DoOnce node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add a DoOnce node to your spell.
2. Connect the desired portion of your spell to the `flow` output of the DoOnce node.
3. Trigger the `flow` input of the DoOnce node to execute the connected portion of the spell once.
4. If you need to allow the connected portion to execute again, trigger the `reset` input of the DoOnce node.

## Example

Imagine you have a spell that processes data from a database and sends notifications based on certain conditions. You want to ensure that the database connection is established only once, even if the spell is triggered multiple times.

1. Add a DoOnce node to your spell.
2. Connect the database connection logic to the `flow` output of the DoOnce node.
3. Connect the rest of your spell (data processing and notification sending) after the database connection logic.
4. Trigger the spell. The database connection will be established once, and the rest of the spell will execute normally.
5. If the database connection is lost and needs to be re-established, trigger the `reset` input of the DoOnce node before triggering the spell again.

## Best Practices

- Use the DoOnce node for initialization tasks, one-time configurations, or actions that should only be performed once in a spell's lifecycle.
- Be mindful of when you need to reset the DoOnce node. Only use the `reset` input when necessary to avoid unintended behavior.

## Common Issues

- Forgetting to reset the DoOnce node when needed can lead to unexpected behavior, as the intended "one-time" action will not be executed again until the node is reset.
- Resetting the DoOnce node too frequently can defeat its purpose and lead to inefficiencies in your spell.

By using the DoOnce node appropriately, you can ensure that specific parts of your spell are executed only once, making your spells more efficient and predictable.
