# DoN

The DoN node is a flow control node that allows you to execute a portion of your spell a specified number of times. It's useful when you need to repeat a series of actions or process data in a loop.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The input flow that triggers the node to start executing.
- `n` (optional, default: 1): An integer specifying the number of times the node should execute its output flow. 
- `reset` (optional): A flow input that, when triggered, resets the internal count back to zero.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The output flow that is triggered `n` times when the node is executed.
- `count`: An integer output providing the current iteration count, starting from 0 and going up to `n-1`.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the `flow` input to the node that should trigger the DoN node to start.
2. Set the `n` input to the desired number of iterations. If left unconnected, it will default to 1.
3. Optionally, connect a flow to the `reset` input if you want to be able to reset the count back to zero mid-execution.
4. Connect the `flow` output to the first node you want to execute in the loop.
5. Continue your spell from the `flow` output, connecting as many nodes as you need.
6. If needed, you can use the `count` output to access the current iteration number.

## Example 

Here's an example spell that uses the DoN node to send a "Hello" message to a Slack channel 5 times:

```
Trigger -> DoN (n=5) -> HTTP Request (POST https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage, payload={"text":"Hello"}) -> Debug
```

In this example:
1. The spell is triggered by some external event 
2. The DoN node is configured to execute 5 times
3. Each iteration, it triggers the HTTP Request node which sends a POST to Slack's chat.postMessage API with the payload `{"text":"Hello"}`
4. The Debug node at the end could be used to log the `count` output from DoN if desired

## Best Practices

- Be mindful of how many iterations you specify, especially if making API calls or database writes in the loop. Too many iterations could lead to rate limiting or excess resource usage.
- Make use of the `reset` input in conjunction with error handling to re-run the loop if a failure occurs partway through.
- You can nest DoN nodes to create more complex looping behavior, but be careful not to create infinite loops!

## Common Issues

- Forgetting to connect the `n` input will cause DoN to only execute once by default. Double check your input if your loop isn't running as many times as expected.
- If your spell seems stuck, double check that you aren't creating an infinite loop by having the `flow` output eventually cycle back to the `flow` input with no exit condition.
