# Gate

The Gate node is a flow control node that allows you to conditionally allow or block the flow of execution in your spell based on external triggers. It acts like a gate or valve, letting the flow pass through when opened and blocking it when closed.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The main flow input that the Gate will control.
- `open`: A flow signal to open the Gate and allow the main flow to pass through.
- `close`: A flow signal to close the Gate and block the main flow.
- `toggle`: A flow signal to toggle the Gate between open and closed states.
- `startClosed` (boolean, default: false): If true, the Gate will start in the closed state. Otherwise, it starts open.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The controlled flow output. Emits the main `flow` input when the Gate is open, and blocks it when closed.

## Usage

1. Connect your main execution flow to the Gate's `flow` input.
2. (Optional) Connect flow signals to the `open`, `close`, and/or `toggle` inputs to control the Gate's state.
3. Set the `startClosed` option if you want the Gate to initially block the flow.
4. Connect the Gate's `flow` output to the next node(s) in your spell.

When the Gate receives a signal on its `open` input, it will allow the main `flow` to pass through to the output. A signal on `close` will block the flow. The `toggle` input switches the Gate between open and closed states each time it receives a signal.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that needs to conditionally send an HTTP request based on some external condition. You can use a Gate node to control the flow:

```
Trigger --> Gate --> HTTP Request
              ^
              |
          Condition
```

The Trigger node starts the flow, which is connected to the Gate's `flow` input. The Condition node (e.g. a Button or Delay node) is connected to the Gate's `toggle` input. 

- When the Condition node fires, it toggles the Gate open, allowing the flow to continue to the HTTP Request node. 
- If the Condition doesn't fire, the Gate remains closed and blocks the flow, preventing the HTTP request.

## Best Practices

- Use Gates judiciously to control flow and resources. Too many Gates can make a spell hard to follow.
- Clearly label Gate nodes and their control inputs (open, close, toggle) to make the flow logic easy to understand at a glance.
- Consider using a single `toggle` input instead of separate `open` and `close` where appropriate to simplify the spell graph.

## Common Issues

- Forgetting to set `startClosed` when you need the Gate to block the initial flow.
- Connecting control signals to the wrong Gate inputs.
- Creating infinite loops by connecting a Gate's output back to its own control inputs incorrectly.

With careful use, the Gate node provides a powerful way to dynamically control the execution flow of your spells based on events and conditions.
