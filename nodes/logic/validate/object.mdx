# Validate

The Validate node checks if the input data conforms to a specified JSON schema. It is useful for ensuring data integrity, validating user input, or enforcing a specific structure on data flowing through your spell.

## Inputs

1. `schema` (object, default: `{}`): The JSON schema to validate the data against. It should follow the JSON Schema specification.
2. `data` (object, default: `{}`): The data object to be validated against the provided schema.

## Outputs

1. `result` (boolean): Indicates whether the validation was successful. Returns `true` if the data is valid according to the schema, and `false` otherwise.
2. `errors` (array): If the validation fails, this output provides an array of validation error messages describing the specific issues encountered.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a JSON schema object to the `schema` input. This schema should define the expected structure and constraints of the data you want to validate.
2. Connect the data object you want to validate to the `data` input.
3. The `result` output will indicate whether the validation was successful or not.
4. If the validation fails, the `errors` output will provide an array of error messages detailing the validation issues.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that processes user registration data. You want to ensure that the user input follows a specific structure before proceeding with the registration. Here's how you can use the Validate node:

1. Define a JSON schema for the user registration data:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "object",
     "properties": {
       "username": { "type": "string", "minLength": 3, "maxLength": 20 },
       "email": { "type": "string", "format": "email" },
       "age": { "type": "integer", "minimum": 18 }
     },
     "required": ["username", "email", "age"]
   }
   ```

2. Connect this schema to the `schema` input of the Validate node.
3. Connect the user registration data (e.g., from a form submission) to the `data` input of the Validate node.
4. The `result` output will be `true` if the user data is valid according to the schema, and `false` otherwise.
5. If the validation fails, the `errors` output will provide an array of error messages, such as:
   ```json
   [
     "username must be at least 3 characters long",
     "email must be a valid email address",
     "age must be greater than or equal to 18"
   ]
   ```

6. Use a Branch node to handle the validation result. If `result` is `true`, proceed with the registration process. If `result` is `false`, handle the validation errors (e.g., display error messages to the user).

## Best Practices

- Ensure that your JSON schema accurately represents the expected structure and constraints of your data.
- Use descriptive error messages in your schema to help identify and troubleshoot validation issues easily.
- Handle validation errors gracefully in your spell, providing clear feedback to users when their input is invalid.

## Common Issues

- Make sure the `schema` input is a valid JSON schema object. Incorrect schema syntax can lead to unexpected validation results.
- Be cautious when defining complex schemas with nested objects or arrays. Test your schema thoroughly to ensure it validates data correctly.
- If the `data` input is not a valid JSON object, the validation may fail with a parsing error.

By using the Validate node, you can ensure data integrity and maintain a consistent structure throughout your spell, catching any invalid data early in the process.
