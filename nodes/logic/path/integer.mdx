# Path (Integer)

The Path (Integer) node in Magick allows you to extract an integer value from a nested object using a dot-notated path string. This is useful when you need to retrieve a specific numeric property from a complex data structure.

## Inputs

1. `pathToSearch` (string, required): The dot-notated path string specifying the location of the integer value to extract from the input object. For example, `"person.age"` would retrieve the `age` property from the `person` object.

2. `obj` (object, required): The input object from which to extract the integer value.

## Outputs

1. `result` (integer): The extracted integer value from the specified path in the input object. If the path is not found or the value is not an integer, the output will be `undefined`.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect an object to the `obj` input of the Path (Integer) node. This is the object from which you want to extract an integer value.

2. Set the `pathToSearch` input to a dot-notated string representing the path to the desired integer value within the input object.

3. The extracted integer value will be available at the `result` output. You can then connect this output to other nodes in your spell as needed.

## Example

Suppose you have an object representing a person with the following structure:

```json
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 30,
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "Anytown",
    "zip": 12345
  }
}
```

To extract the `age` value from this object, you would:

1. Connect the person object to the `obj` input of the Path (Integer) node.
2. Set the `pathToSearch` input to `"age"`.
3. The `result` output will contain the integer value `30`.

To extract the `zip` value from the nested `address` object, you would:

1. Connect the person object to the `obj` input of the Path (Integer) node.
2. Set the `pathToSearch` input to `"address.zip"`.
3. The `result` output will contain the integer value `12345`.

## Best Practices

- Make sure the `pathToSearch` string correctly matches the structure of your input object. Double-check the property names and nesting.
- If the specified path doesn't exist in the input object, the `result` output will be `undefined`. Handle this case appropriately in your spell's logic.

## Common Issues

- If the value at the specified path is not an integer, the `result` output will be `undefined`. Ensure that the path points to an integer value.
- Be careful with the casing and spelling of property names in the `pathToSearch` string. JavaScript is case-sensitive, so `"age"` and `"Age"` are considered different properties.
