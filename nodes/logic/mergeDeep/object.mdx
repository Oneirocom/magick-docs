# Merge Deep (Object)

The Merge Deep (Object) node deeply merges two objects, recursively combining their properties. If both objects have a property with the same key, the values will be merged if they are both objects, otherwise the value from object `b` will overwrite the value from object `a`.

## Inputs

1. `a` (object, default: `{}`): The first object to merge.
2. `b` (object, default: `{}`): The second object to merge.

## Outputs

1. `result` (object): The merged object.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Merge Deep (Object) node:

1. Connect two objects to the `a` and `b` input ports. If no objects are connected, the node will use the default empty object `{}`.
2. The node will output the deeply merged object on the `result` port.

## Example

Suppose you have two objects:

```json
// Object A
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
      "city": "New York",
      "country": "USA"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "theme": "dark"
  }
}

// Object B
{
  "user": {
    "age": 31,
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "address": {
      "city": "Los Angeles"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

When you pass these objects through the Merge Deep (Object) node, the output will be:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 31,
    "email": "alice@example.com",
    "address": {
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "country": "USA"
    }
  },
  "settings": {
    "theme": "dark",
    "language": "en"
  }
}
```

Notice how:
- The `user` object is merged recursively
- `age` from object B overwrites the value from object A
- `email` is added from object B
- The `address` object is merged, with `city` from object B overwriting the value from object A
- The `settings` object is merged, with `language` added from object B

## Best Practices

- Use Merge Deep (Object) when you need to combine two objects while preserving the structure of nested objects.
- Be aware that properties from object `b` will overwrite properties with the same key in object `a`, unless both values are objects, in which case they will be merged recursively.

## Common Issues

- If either input is not an object, the node will throw an error. Ensure that you are connecting objects to the `a` and `b` inputs.
- If you want a shallow merge instead of a deep merge, use the Merge (Object) node instead.
