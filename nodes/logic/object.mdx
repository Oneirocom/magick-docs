# Object

The Object node in Magick is a fundamental utility node that allows you to create, manipulate, and output JavaScript objects within your spells. It provides a simple way to work with structured data and can be used in a wide variety of scenarios.

## Inputs

- `a` (object, default: `{}`): The input object to be processed or modified by the node. If no input is provided, an empty object `{}` will be used as the default.

## Outputs

- `result` (object): The resulting object after any modifications or transformations have been applied.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add an Object node to your spell.
2. Connect the desired input object to the `a` input port. If you want to start with an empty object, you can skip this step.
3. The Object node will output the input object as-is, without any modifications, through the `result` output port.
4. You can then connect the `result` output to other nodes in your spell to perform further operations or use the object data as needed.

## Example

Here's a simple example of how you can use the Object node in a Magick spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "logic/object",
      "id": "object1",
      "inputs": {
        "a": {
          "name": "John",
          "age": 30,
          "city": "New York"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "debug/log",
      "id": "log1",
      "inputs": {
        "message": "{{object1.result}}"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. The Object node `object1` is created with an input object containing properties like `name`, `age`, and `city`.
2. The `result` output of `object1` is connected to the `message` input of a Debug Log node `log1`.
3. When the spell is run, the Debug Log node will log the object data to the console.

## Best Practices

- Use the Object node to create and manage structured data within your spells.
- Connect the `result` output to other nodes that expect object data as input.
- If you need to modify the object, you can use other nodes like the Edit Object node to add, remove, or update properties.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the input data connected to the `a` input port is a valid JavaScript object. Passing non-object data may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Be mindful of the object structure and property names when accessing or modifying the object data in other nodes.

By using the Object node in Magick, you can easily work with structured data and integrate it seamlessly into your spells. It provides a foundation for creating more complex data manipulations and enables you to build powerful and flexible spells.
