# Assoc Path

The Assoc Path node in Magick allows you to set a value at a specified path within a nested object. It provides a convenient way to update or add properties deep within an object structure without mutating the original object.

## Inputs

1. `path` (string, default: `""`) - The path to the property you want to set, specified as a string of keys separated by dots (e.g., `"a.b.c"`).
2. `newValue` (object, default: `{}`) - The new value you want to set at the specified path.
3. `obj` (object, default: `{}`) - The original object in which you want to set the value.

## Outputs

1. `result` (object) - A new object with the value set at the specified path, leaving the original object unchanged.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Assoc Path node:

1. Connect an object to the `obj` input. This is the object you want to update.
2. Specify the path to the property you want to set in the `path` input. Use dot notation to navigate nested objects (e.g., `"a.b.c"`).
3. Connect the new value you want to set to the `newValue` input.
4. The node will output a new object with the value set at the specified path, leaving the original object unchanged.

## Example

Suppose you have the following object:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
      "city": "New York",
      "country": "USA"
    }
  }
}
```

If you want to update the `city` property within the `address` object, you can use the Assoc Path node like this:

- Set the `obj` input to the original object.
- Set the `path` input to `"user.address.city"`.
- Set the `newValue` input to `"Los Angeles"`.

The node will output a new object with the updated `city` property:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "name": "John", 
    "age": 30,
    "address": {
      "city": "Los Angeles",
      "country": "USA"
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

- Use clear and concise path strings to avoid confusion.
- Be cautious when setting values in deeply nested objects, as it can make the code harder to read and maintain.
- Remember that the Assoc Path node does not mutate the original object, so make sure to use the output object if you want to work with the updated values.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the path string is correctly formatted with keys separated by dots. Incorrect path formats will result in unexpected behavior.
- If the specified path does not exist in the original object, the Assoc Path node will create the necessary nested objects to set the value.

By using the Assoc Path node, you can easily update or add values to specific paths within nested objects in your Magick spells, making your code more readable and maintainable.
