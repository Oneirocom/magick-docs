# Concat

The Concat node combines three input arrays into a single output array in the order the inputs are provided.

## Inputs

1. `a` (array): The first array to concatenate. Default value is an empty array.
2. `b` (array): The second array to concatenate. Default value is an empty array. 
3. `c` (array): The third array to concatenate. Default value is an empty array.

## Outputs

1. `result` (array): The array resulting from concatenating the `a`, `b`, and `c` input arrays in order.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Concat node:

1. Add the Concat node to your spell.
2. Connect arrays to the `a`, `b`, and `c` input ports as desired. Any or all of the inputs can be left empty.
3. The concatenated array will be output from the `result` port.

## Example

Let's say you have three separate arrays with names, job titles, and departments in your company directory:

```json
names = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
titles = ["Software Engineer", "Product Manager", "UX Designer"] 
departments = ["Engineering", "Product", "Design"]
```

Connecting these to the `a`, `b`, and `c` inputs of the Concat node will output:

```json
result = [
  "Alice",
  "Bob", 
  "Carol",
  "Software Engineer",
  "Product Manager",
  "UX Designer",
  "Engineering",
  "Product",
  "Design"
]
```

## Best Practices

- The order of the concatenated arrays will match the order of the inputs. Put the arrays in the desired sequence.
- It's not required to connect arrays to all three inputs. Any empty inputs will simply be ignored.
- The input arrays don't need to be the same length. The output will contain all elements from each.

## Common Pitfalls

- Be cautious of accidentally duplicating data if the same array is connected to multiple inputs.
- Note that this node does not do any sort of merging of the arrays. The output is a simple concatenation.
