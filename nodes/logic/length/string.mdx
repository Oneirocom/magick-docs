# Length

The Length node is a utility node that calculates the length of a given string input. It is commonly used in text processing and validation workflows to determine the number of characters in a string.

## Inputs

- `a` (string, default: ""): The input string to calculate the length of.

## Outputs

- `result` (integer): The length of the input string.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a node that provides a string output to the `a` input of the Length node.
2. The Length node will calculate the number of characters in the input string.
3. The `result` output will contain the length of the input string as an integer value.
4. Connect the `result` output to other nodes that require the string length for further processing or validation.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Length node in a spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "data/input/string",
      "id": "inputString",
      "configuration": {
        "value": "Hello, World!"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "logic/length/string",
      "id": "lengthNode"
    },
    {
      "type": "data/output/number",
      "id": "outputLength"
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "source": "inputString.output",
      "target": "lengthNode.a"
    },
    {
      "source": "lengthNode.result",
      "target": "outputLength.input"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. The `data/input/string` node provides the input string "Hello, World!".
2. The `logic/length/string` node calculates the length of the input string.
3. The `data/output/number` node outputs the length of the string, which is 13.

## Best Practices

- Use the Length node when you need to determine the number of characters in a string for validation, formatting, or further processing.
- Connect the Length node to a string input source, such as a `data/input/string` node or the output of another node that provides a string value.
- Use the `result` output of the Length node to pass the string length to other nodes that require this information.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the input connected to the `a` input of the Length node is a valid string. Connecting a non-string value may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
- Keep in mind that the Length node counts all characters in the string, including whitespace characters like spaces, tabs, and newline characters.

By using the Length node, you can easily calculate the length of a string and use that information in your Magick spells for various text processing and validation tasks.
