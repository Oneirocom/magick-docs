# Integer

The Integer node is a simple utility node that allows you to input an integer value and pass it to other nodes in your spell. It is useful when you need to provide a specific integer value as an input to another node.

## Inputs

- `a` (integer, default: 0): The integer value to be passed through the node.

## Outputs

- `result` (integer): The input integer value, passed through unchanged.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add an Integer node to your spell.
2. Connect the `result` output to the input of the node that requires an integer value.
3. Set the value of the `a` input to the desired integer.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that generates a random number between 0 and a maximum value. You can use the Integer node to provide the maximum value:

1. Add a Random Number node to your spell.
2. Add an Integer node to your spell.
3. Connect the `result` output of the Integer node to the `max` input of the Random Number node.
4. Set the `a` input of the Integer node to the desired maximum value, e.g., 100.

Now, the Random Number node will generate a random integer between 0 and the value provided by the Integer node.

## Best Practices

- Use the Integer node whenever you need to input a specific integer value into your spell.
- Consider renaming the node to something more descriptive of its purpose in your spell, e.g., "Max Random Value" or "Number of Items".

## Common Issues

There are no common issues or gotchas associated with the Integer node, as it simply passes through the input value unchanged.
