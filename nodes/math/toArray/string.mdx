# To Array (String)

The To Array (String) node in Magick converts a string into an array, with each character in the string becoming an element in the resulting array.

## Inputs

- `a` (string, default: ""): The input string to be converted into an array.

## Outputs

- `result` (array): The resulting array, where each element corresponds to a character from the input string.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the To Array (String) node:

1. Connect a node that outputs a string to the `a` input of the To Array (String) node.
2. The resulting array will be available at the `result` output, which can be connected to other nodes for further processing.

## Example

Suppose you have a string "Hello" that you want to convert into an array. Here's how you can use the To Array (String) node to achieve this:

1. Create a Constant node and set its value to "Hello".
2. Connect the output of the Constant node to the `a` input of the To Array (String) node.
3. The `result` output of the To Array (String) node will now contain the array `["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]`.

Here's an example spell that demonstrates this:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "data/constant",
      "id": "1",
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "output",
          "type": "string",
          "value": "Hello"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "math/toArray/string",
      "id": "2",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "a",
          "type": "string",
          "connected": true,
          "connectedOutput": "output",
          "connectedNode": "1"
        }
      ],
      "outputs": [
        {
          "name": "result",
          "type": "array"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

In this spell, the Constant node (ID: 1) outputs the string "Hello", which is connected to the `a` input of the To Array (String) node (ID: 2). The resulting array `["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]` is available at the `result` output of the To Array (String) node.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the input to the To Array (String) node is a valid string. Connecting a non-string value may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
- Keep in mind that the resulting array will have the same number of elements as the number of characters in the input string, including whitespace characters.

## Common Issues

- If the input string is empty, the resulting array will also be empty.
- If the input is not a string, the node may produce an error or unexpected results. Always ensure that the connected input is of the correct type.

By using the To Array (String) node, you can easily convert a string into an array of its individual characters, which can be useful for various string manipulation tasks in your Magick spells.
