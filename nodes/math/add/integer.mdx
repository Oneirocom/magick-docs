# Add Integers

The Add Integers node performs addition on two input integers and outputs the result. It's a fundamental math operation useful in a wide variety of spells that require arithmetic.

## Inputs

- `a` (integer): The first integer to add. Default value is 0.
- `b` (integer): The second integer to add. Default value is 0.

## Outputs

- `result` (integer): The sum of the two input integers.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add the Add Integers node to your spell.
2. Connect integer values to the `a` and `b` input ports. These can be hard-coded constants or outputs from other nodes.
3. The node will output the sum of `a` and `b` from its `result` port. 
4. Connect the `result` to the input of another node or use it as the spell's final output.

## Example

Here's a simple spell that adds two hard-coded integers and prints the result:

```
1. Add Integers node:
   - a: 10
   - b: 25
   - result -> connected to Print's value input
2. Print node:
   - value: connected from Add Integers' result 
```

When this spell is run, it will add 10 and 25 using the Add Integers node, and print the result (35) using the Print node.

## Tips

- If you leave an input disconnected, it will use its default value of 0.
- You can chain multiple Add Integers nodes together to sum more than two numbers.
- Remember that this node works only with integers. For floating-point math, use the Add Floats node instead.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that the values connected to `a` and `b` are actually integers. Connecting a string or other data type will cause an error.
- If the result is larger than the maximum integer value your system supports, it will overflow. Use the Add Bigints node for arbitrarily large numbers.
