# Float

The Float node is a simple utility node that allows you to input a floating-point number and pass it as an output to other nodes in your spell. It is useful when you need to provide a specific numeric value to a node that expects a float input.

## Inputs

- `a` (float, default: 0): The input floating-point number.

## Outputs

- `result` (float): The floating-point number passed through from the input.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add a Float node to your spell.
2. Connect the `result` output to the input of the node that requires a floating-point number.
3. Set the value of the `a` input to the desired floating-point number.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that generates a random number between 0 and a maximum value. You can use the Float node to provide the maximum value:

1. Add a Float node to your spell.
2. Set the `a` input of the Float node to the desired maximum value, e.g., 100.
3. Connect the `result` output of the Float node to the `max` input of a Random Float node.
4. The Random Float node will now generate random numbers between 0 and the value provided by the Float node.

## Tips

- Use the Float node whenever you need to input a specific floating-point number into your spell.
- You can change the value of the `a` input dynamically to adjust the behavior of your spell without modifying the node configuration.

## Gotchas

- Make sure to connect the `result` output to a node that expects a floating-point input. Connecting it to a node that expects a different data type may cause unexpected behavior.
- Be aware of the numeric precision limitations of floating-point numbers when working with very large or very small values.
