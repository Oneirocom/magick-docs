# LOG2

The LOG2 node calculates the base-2 logarithm of a given floating-point number. It is useful when you need to determine the power to which the number 2 must be raised to obtain the input value.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The floating-point number for which you want to calculate the base-2 logarithm.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The base-2 logarithm of the input value.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a floating-point number to the `a` input of the LOG2 node.
2. The node will calculate the base-2 logarithm of the input value and output the result through the `result` output.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that needs to calculate the base-2 logarithm of a given number. You can use the LOG2 node to accomplish this task.

1. Create a new spell and add a Constant node to provide the input value. Set the value to 8.
2. Add a LOG2 node to the canvas and connect the output of the Constant node to the `a` input of the LOG2 node.
3. Add a Debug node and connect the `result` output of the LOG2 node to the input of the Debug node.
4. Run the spell. The Debug node will display the base-2 logarithm of 8, which is 3.

In this example, the LOG2 node calculates that 2 raised to the power of 3 equals 8 (2^3 = 8).

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the input value is a valid floating-point number. Passing non-numeric values may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
- Keep in mind that the LOG2 node calculates the base-2 logarithm. If you need to calculate logarithms with a different base, you can use the change of base formula or other logarithm nodes provided by Magick.

## Common Issues

- Passing a negative number to the LOG2 node will result in a NaN (Not a Number) output, as logarithms are not defined for negative values.
- Passing 0 to the LOG2 node will result in negative infinity, as the logarithm of 0 is undefined.

By using the LOG2 node, you can easily calculate base-2 logarithms within your Magick spells, enabling you to perform mathematical operations and transformations on your data.
