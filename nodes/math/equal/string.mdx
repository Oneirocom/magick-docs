# Equal (String)

The Equal (String) node compares two input strings and outputs a boolean value indicating whether they are equal.

## Inputs

1. `a` (string): The first string to compare. Default value is an empty string.
2. `b` (string): The second string to compare. Default value is an empty string.

## Outputs

1. `result` (boolean): The result of the equality comparison. Returns `true` if the input strings are equal, and `false` otherwise.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Equal (String) node:

1. Connect the first string to compare to the `a` input.
2. Connect the second string to compare to the `b` input.
3. The `result` output will emit `true` if the input strings are equal, and `false` otherwise.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Equal (String) node in a spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "input/string",
      "id": "string1",
      "data": {
        "string": "hello"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "input/string", 
      "id": "string2",
      "data": {
        "string": "world"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "math/equal/string",
      "id": "equalNode",
      "inputs": {
        "a": "string1",
        "b": "string2"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "output/boolean",
      "id": "output",
      "inputs": {
        "boolean": "equalNode"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. Two string input nodes provide the strings "hello" and "world".
2. The Equal (String) node compares these two strings. 
3. The output boolean node emits the result of the comparison, which in this case would be `false` since "hello" does not equal "world".

## Best Practices

- Ensure that both inputs are properly connected before running the spell.
- Keep in mind that the comparison is case-sensitive. "Hello" and "hello" will be considered unequal.
- If you need to compare strings while ignoring case, consider using a string manipulation node to convert both strings to the same case before the comparison.

## Common Issues

- Forgetting to connect one or both inputs will result in the node comparing against empty strings, which may lead to unexpected results.
- Attempting to compare non-string values will cause an error. Ensure that any values passed to this node are explicitly cast as strings.
