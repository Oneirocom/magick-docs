# Equal (Float)

The Equal (Float) node compares two floating-point numbers and outputs a boolean value indicating whether they are equal.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The first floating-point number to compare.
2. `b` (float, default: 0): The second floating-point number to compare.

## Outputs

1. `result` (boolean): The result of the equality comparison. Returns `true` if `a` is equal to `b`, and `false` otherwise.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

The Equal (Float) node is used to determine if two floating-point numbers are equal. It is particularly useful in conditional statements or for validating user input.

To use the Equal (Float) node:

1. Connect the first floating-point number to the `a` input.
2. Connect the second floating-point number to the `b` input.
3. The `result` output will emit `true` if the two input numbers are equal, and `false` otherwise.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Equal (Float) node in a spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "input/number",
      "id": "input1",
      "data": { "value": 3.14 }
    },
    {
      "type": "input/number", 
      "id": "input2",
      "data": { "value": 3.14 }
    },
    {
      "type": "math/equal/float",
      "id": "equalNode",
      "inputs": {
        "a": { "nodeId": "input1", "output": "value" },
        "b": { "nodeId": "input2", "output": "value" }
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "output/boolean",
      "id": "output",
      "inputs": {
        "value": { "nodeId": "equalNode", "output": "result" }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example, two `input/number` nodes provide the floating-point numbers to compare. The Equal (Float) node compares these numbers and passes the boolean result to an `output/boolean` node.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the inputs to the Equal (Float) node are actually floating-point numbers. Connecting other data types may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Keep in mind that floating-point comparisons can sometimes be imprecise due to the way computers represent decimal numbers. For more precise comparisons, consider using the Equal (String) node with string representations of the numbers.

## Common Issues

- If the Equal (Float) node always returns `false`, double-check that the input values are the expected floating-point numbers and that they are truly equal. Slight variations in the decimal places can cause the equality check to fail.
