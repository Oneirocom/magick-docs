# Equal (Boolean)

The Equal (Boolean) node compares two boolean values and outputs `true` if they are equal, or `false` if they are not equal.

## Inputs

- `a` (boolean): The first boolean value to compare. Defaults to `false`.
- `b` (boolean): The second boolean value to compare. Defaults to `false`.

## Outputs

- `result` (boolean): The result of the equality comparison. Will be `true` if `a` and `b` are equal, or `false` if they are not equal.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the first boolean value to compare to the `a` input.
2. Connect the second boolean value to compare to the `b` input.
3. The `result` output will emit `true` if `a` and `b` are equal, or `false` if they are not equal.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Equal (Boolean) node in a spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "boolean/constant",
      "id": "1",
      "configuration": {
        "value": true
      },
      "outputs": {
        "output": "2.a"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "boolean/constant", 
      "id": "3",
      "configuration": {
        "value": false
      },
      "outputs": {
        "output": "2.b"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "math/equal/boolean",
      "id": "2",
      "outputs": {
        "result": "4.input"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "io/output/boolean",
      "id": "4"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. Node 1 is a Boolean Constant node that outputs `true`. 
2. Node 3 is another Boolean Constant node that outputs `false`.
3. The outputs of nodes 1 and 3 are connected to the `a` and `b` inputs of the Equal (Boolean) node (node 2).
4. The Equal (Boolean) node compares the two input values. Since `true` is not equal to `false`, it outputs `false`.
5. The output of the Equal (Boolean) node is sent to an Output (Boolean) node (node 4), which would make the result available outside the spell.

## Best Practices

- Make sure to connect both the `a` and `b` inputs. If either is left disconnected, it will default to `false`.
- The Equal (Boolean) node is useful whenever you need to test if two boolean values are the same. This is often used in conditional logic or data validation.

## Common Issues

There are no common issues specific to this node. As long as both inputs are properly connected to boolean values, it will function as expected.
