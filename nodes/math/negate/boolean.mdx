# ¬ (Boolean Negate)

The Boolean Negate node (represented by the "¬" symbol) is a simple logical operator that inverts the value of a boolean input. If the input is `true`, the output will be `false`, and vice versa.

## Inputs

- `a` (boolean, default: `false`): The boolean value to be negated.

## Outputs

- `result` (boolean): The negated value of the input.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a boolean value to the `a` input of the Boolean Negate node.
2. The negated value will be available at the `result` output.

## Example

Consider a spell where you want to perform an action only if a certain condition is not met. You can use the Boolean Negate node to invert the condition before connecting it to a trigger or filter node.

```markdown
1. [Input] Condition (boolean) 
2. [Math] ¬ (Boolean Negate)
   - a: [connected to Condition output]
3. [Logic] If
   - condition: [connected to ¬ (Boolean Negate) result output]
   - then: [Action to perform when condition is not met]
```

In this example, the Boolean Negate node inverts the `Condition` input before it is passed to the `If` node. The action connected to the `then` input of the `If` node will only be executed when the original `Condition` is `false`.

## Best Practices

- Use the Boolean Negate node to simplify your spell's logic by inverting conditions directly, rather than using more complex expressions.
- Consider readability when using the Boolean Negate node. In some cases, it may be clearer to write the inverted condition explicitly rather than using the negate node.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the input connected to the Boolean Negate node is actually a boolean value. Connecting other data types may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Remember that the Boolean Negate node only inverts the value; it does not change the value type. The output will always be a boolean.
