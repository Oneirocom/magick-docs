# Math Negate Float

The Math Negate Float node performs a simple negation operation on a floating-point number. It takes a single float input and outputs the negated value.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The input floating-point number to be negated.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The negated value of the input.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Math Negate Float node:

1. Add the Math Negate Float node to your spell.
2. Connect a node that outputs a floating-point number to the `a` input of the Math Negate Float node.
3. The negated value will be available at the `result` output.

## Example

Here's a simple example spell that demonstrates the usage of the Math Negate Float node:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "input/float",
      "id": "1",
      "configuration": {
        "value": 42.5
      },
      "outputs": {
        "output": "2.a"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "math/negate/float",
      "id": "2",
      "inputs": {
        "a": "1.output"
      },
      "outputs": {
        "result": "3.input"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "output/float",
      "id": "3",
      "inputs": {
        "input": "2.result"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. The `input/float` node (ID: 1) provides a floating-point value of 42.5.
2. The `math/negate/float` node (ID: 2) takes the value from node 1 and negates it.
3. The `output/float` node (ID: 3) receives the negated value from node 2 and outputs it.

The final output of this spell will be -42.5.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the input to the Math Negate Float node is a valid floating-point number. Connecting nodes with incompatible types may lead to errors.

## Common Issues

- No known common issues for this node. It performs a straightforward negation operation on floating-point numbers.

The Math Negate Float node is a simple utility node for negating floating-point values. It can be useful in various mathematical and data processing spells where negation is required.
