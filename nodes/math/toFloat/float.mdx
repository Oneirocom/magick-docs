# To Float

The To Float node converts a value to a floating-point number.

## Inputs

- `a` (float): The value to convert to a float. Default value is 0.

## Outputs

- `result` (float): The input value converted to a floating-point number.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the value you want to convert to the `a` input of the To Float node.
2. The converted floating-point value will be available at the `result` output.

## Example

Let's say you have a spell that retrieves a number as a string from an API response, but you need to perform mathematical operations on this value. You can use the To Float node to convert the string to a float before using it in your calculations.

```
1. API Request
   URL: https://example.com/data
   
2. Get 'price' from response
   Input: API Request output
   Property: price
   
3. To Float
   a: Get 'price' output
   
4. Multiply
   a: To Float output
   b: 1.1
   
5. Format Number
   number: Multiply output
   decimals: 2
```

In this example, the 'price' value from the API response is extracted as a string using the Get node. The To Float node then converts this string value to a floating-point number. The converted value is multiplied by 1.1 and finally formatted with 2 decimal places for display.

## Best Practices

- Make sure the input value can be parsed as a floating-point number. Non-numeric strings will result in a NaN (Not a Number) output.
- Be aware of the precision limitations of floating-point numbers when performing calculations.

## Common Issues

- Passing a non-numeric string to the To Float node will result in a NaN output. Make sure to validate or sanitize input data if necessary.
- Floating-point arithmetic can sometimes produce unexpected results due to precision limitations. If you need exact decimal calculations, consider using a decimal library or rounding results as needed.
