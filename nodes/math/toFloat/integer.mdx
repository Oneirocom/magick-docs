# To Float (Integer)

The To Float (Integer) node in Magick converts an integer value to a floating-point number. This is useful when you need to perform mathematical operations that require floating-point precision or when working with nodes that expect float inputs.

## Inputs

- `a` (integer, default: 0): The integer value to be converted to a float.

## Outputs

- `result` (float): The floating-point representation of the input integer.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the integer value you want to convert to the `a` input of the To Float (Integer) node.
2. The node will output the floating-point equivalent of the input integer through its `result` output.
3. Connect the `result` output to the desired destination node or use it for further processing.

## Example

Suppose you have an integer value representing the number of items in a list, and you want to calculate the average price of those items. However, the node that calculates the average expects floating-point inputs. In this case, you can use the To Float (Integer) node to convert the integer count to a float before passing it to the average calculation node.

Here's an example spell:

```
1. Create a Number node and set its value to the integer count of items (e.g., 5).
2. Connect the output of the Number node to the `a` input of a To Float (Integer) node.
3. Create a List of Numbers node and populate it with the prices of the items (e.g., [10.99, 5.49, 8.75, 12.50, 7.99]).
4. Connect the output of the List of Numbers node to the `list` input of an Average node.
5. Connect the `result` output of the To Float (Integer) node to the `count` input of the Average node.
6. The Average node will output the calculated average price of the items.
```

In this example, the To Float (Integer) node is used to convert the integer count of items to a float, enabling the Average node to correctly calculate the average price.

## Best Practices

- Use the To Float (Integer) node whenever you need to convert an integer to a floating-point number for compatibility with other nodes or mathematical operations.
- Be aware that converting an integer to a float may introduce slight precision differences due to the nature of floating-point representation.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the input to the To Float (Integer) node is a valid integer. Passing non-integer values may result in unexpected behavior or errors.
- Keep in mind that the floating-point result may have a different precision than the original integer value, especially for large numbers.

By using the To Float (Integer) node, you can seamlessly convert integer values to floating-point numbers, enabling greater flexibility and compatibility within your Magick spells.
