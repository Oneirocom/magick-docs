# Math Multiply Float

The Math Multiply Float node performs a simple multiplication operation on two floating-point numbers. It takes two input values, multiplies them together, and outputs the result.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The first number to multiply.
2. `b` (float, default: 0): The second number to multiply.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The product of the two input numbers.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Math Multiply Float node:

1. Add the Math Multiply Float node to your spell.
2. Connect the `a` input to the first number you want to multiply.
3. Connect the `b` input to the second number you want to multiply.
4. The `result` output will contain the product of the two input numbers.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. You can use the Math Multiply Float node to multiply the length and width together:

```
[Input:Length] -> [a][Math Multiply Float][result] -> [Input:Area]
[Input:Width]  -> [b]
```

In this example, the `Length` input is connected to the `a` input of the Math Multiply Float node, and the `Width` input is connected to the `b` input. The `result` output of the node is then connected to the `Area` output of the spell.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that both input values are of the correct data type (float). Connecting inputs of the wrong type may cause unexpected behavior.
- Remember that the order of the inputs does not affect the result, as multiplication is commutative.

## Common Issues

- If either of the input values is not a valid floating-point number, the node will output `NaN` (Not a Number). Make sure to handle this case appropriately in your spell.
- Be aware of the limitations of floating-point precision. In some cases, the result may not be exactly what you expect due to rounding errors.

By using the Math Multiply Float node, you can easily perform multiplication operations on floating-point numbers within your Magick spells. This simple yet essential node is a building block for many common mathematical operations.
