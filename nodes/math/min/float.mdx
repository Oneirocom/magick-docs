# MIN

The MIN node is a utility node that takes two floating-point numbers as input and outputs the smaller of the two values. It is useful when you need to determine the minimum value between two numbers in your spell.

## Inputs

- `a` (float): The first number to compare. Default value is 0.
- `b` (float): The second number to compare. Default value is 0.

## Outputs

- `result` (float): The smaller value between the two input numbers.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the first number you want to compare to the `a` input.
2. Connect the second number you want to compare to the `b` input.
3. The `result` output will provide the minimum value between `a` and `b`.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that generates two random numbers between 0 and 100, and you want to use the smaller number for further processing. You can use the MIN node to determine the minimum value:

```
// Generate two random numbers
[Random Float] (min: 0, max: 100) -> [MIN].a
[Random Float] (min: 0, max: 100) -> [MIN].b

// Use the minimum value
[MIN].result -> [Some Other Node]
```

In this example, the two random numbers are connected to the `a` and `b` inputs of the MIN node. The `result` output will provide the smaller of the two generated numbers, which can then be used as input for subsequent nodes in your spell.

## Tips

- If you connect only one input, the MIN node will output that value regardless of the other input.
- You can chain multiple MIN nodes together to find the minimum value among more than two numbers.

## Caution

Be aware that if either of the inputs is not connected or receives a non-numeric value, the MIN node will output 0 (the default value for unconnected inputs).
