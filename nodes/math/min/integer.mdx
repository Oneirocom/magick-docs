# MIN

The MIN node is a utility node that takes two integer inputs and outputs the smaller of the two values. It's a simple yet powerful node that can be used in a variety of scenarios where you need to determine the minimum value between two integers.

## Inputs

1. `a` (integer, default: 0): The first integer value to compare.
2. `b` (integer, default: 0): The second integer value to compare.

## Outputs

1. `result` (integer): The smaller of the two input values.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

To use the MIN node, simply connect two integer values to the `a` and `b` inputs. The node will output the smaller of the two values through the `result` output.

This node is particularly useful when you need to make decisions based on the minimum value between two integers or when you want to limit a value to a certain range.

## Example

Let's say you have a spell that generates a random number between 1 and 100, but you want to ensure that the final output is never greater than 50. You can use the MIN node to achieve this:

1. Connect the random number generator's output to the `a` input of the MIN node.
2. Set the `b` input of the MIN node to the constant value 50.
3. Connect the `result` output of the MIN node to the next node in your spell.

Now, regardless of the random number generated, the output of the MIN node will never exceed 50.

## Best Practices

- Make sure to connect integer values to the `a` and `b` inputs. Connecting other data types may lead to unexpected behavior.
- If you only need to compare one value against a constant, consider using the `b` input for the constant value to make your spell more readable.

## Common Issues

- If the MIN node is not outputting the expected result, double-check that the connected inputs are integers and not other data types.
- Keep in mind that the MIN node only works with integers. If you need to find the minimum value between floating-point numbers or other data types, you'll need to use a different node or convert the values to integers first.

By using the MIN node in your spells, you can easily determine the minimum value between two integers, helping you create more dynamic and responsive visual programs in Magick.
