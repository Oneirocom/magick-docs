# To Boolean (String)

The To Boolean (String) node converts a string value to a boolean (`true` or `false`). It evaluates the input string and returns `true` if the string is `"true"` (case-insensitive), and `false` otherwise.

## Inputs

- `a` (string, default: `""`) - The input string to be converted to a boolean value.

## Outputs

- `result` (boolean) - The boolean result of the conversion. Returns `true` if the input string is `"true"` (case-insensitive), and `false` otherwise.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a string value to the `a` input of the To Boolean (String) node.
2. The node will evaluate the input string and output the corresponding boolean value (`true` or `false`) from the `result` output.

## Example

Suppose you have a string value that represents a boolean, such as `"true"` or `"false"`, and you want to convert it to an actual boolean value for further processing in your spell.

1. Add a To Boolean (String) node to your spell.
2. Connect the string value (e.g., `"true"` or `"false"`) to the `a` input of the node.
3. The node will output the corresponding boolean value (`true` or `false`) from the `result` output.
4. You can then use the boolean output in other nodes that expect a boolean input, such as a Branch node or a Filter node.

Here's an example spell that demonstrates the usage of the To Boolean (String) node:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[String: "true"] --> B[To Boolean (String)]
B --> C{Branch}
C -->|True| D[Action 1]
C -->|False| E[Action 2]
```

In this example, the string value `"true"` is connected to the To Boolean (String) node, which converts it to the boolean value `true`. The boolean output is then connected to a Branch node, which executes "Action 1" if the value is `true`, and "Action 2" if the value is `false`.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the input string is either `"true"` or `"false"` (case-insensitive) for accurate boolean conversion. Other string values will be considered as `false`.
- Use the To Boolean (String) node when you have a string representation of a boolean value that needs to be converted to an actual boolean for further processing in your spell.

## Common Issues

- If the input string is not `"true"` or `"false"` (case-insensitive), the node will output `false`. Make sure to provide the correct string values for accurate boolean conversion.
