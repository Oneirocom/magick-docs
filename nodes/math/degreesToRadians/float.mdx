# To Radians (math/degreesToRadians/float)

The To Radians node converts an angle measured in degrees to its equivalent value in radians. This is a common operation when working with trigonometric functions or performing calculations involving angles.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The angle in degrees to be converted to radians.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The equivalent angle in radians.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

To use the To Radians node:

1. Add the To Radians node to your spell.
2. Connect the angle in degrees you want to convert to the `a` input.
3. The equivalent angle in radians will be output from the `result` output.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the To Radians node in a spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "math/degreesToRadians/float",
      "id": "toRadiansNode",
      "inputs": {
        "a": 45
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "math/sin/float",
      "id": "sinNode",
      "inputs": {
        "a": "@toRadiansNode.result"
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "output/float",
      "id": "outputNode",
      "inputs": {
        "value": "@sinNode.result"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. The To Radians node (`toRadiansNode`) takes an input angle of 45 degrees and converts it to radians.
2. The output of `toRadiansNode` is connected to the input of a Sin node (`sinNode`), which calculates the sine of the angle in radians.
3. Finally, the result of `sinNode` is sent to an Output node (`outputNode`) to display the result.

This spell demonstrates how the To Radians node can be used to convert degrees to radians before passing the value to a trigonometric function like sine.

## Best Practices

- Remember that many mathematical functions in programming languages, including trigonometric functions, expect angles to be in radians. Always convert degrees to radians before using these functions.
- If you're working primarily with radians, consider converting degrees to radians early in your spell to maintain consistency.

## Common Issues

- Forgetting to convert degrees to radians before using trigonometric functions is a common mistake. If you get unexpected results when using angles, double-check that you've performed the necessary conversion.
- Keep in mind that the conversion factor between degrees and radians is Ï€/180. Make sure you're using the correct conversion factor.
