# Math Less Than (Float)

The Math Less Than (Float) node compares two floating-point numbers and outputs a boolean value indicating whether the first input is less than the second.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The first number to compare.
2. `b` (float, default: 0): The second number to compare.

## Outputs

1. `result` (boolean): True if `a` is less than `b`, false otherwise.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Math Less Than (Float) node:

1. Add the node to your spell.
2. Connect the `a` input to the first floating-point number you want to compare.
3. Connect the `b` input to the second floating-point number you want to compare.
4. The `result` output will emit a boolean value indicating whether `a` is less than `b`.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that needs to check if a user's age is less than 18. You can use the Math Less Than (Float) node to perform this comparison:

```
1. Create an Input Node for the user's age and connect it to the `a` input of the Math Less Than (Float) node.
2. Create a Constant Node with the value 18 and connect it to the `b` input.
3. Connect the `result` output to a Decision Node to handle the case when the user is under 18.
```

In this example, if the user's age is less than 18, the `result` output will be true, and the spell can take appropriate action based on the Decision Node's configuration.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that both inputs are valid floating-point numbers to avoid unexpected behavior.
- Remember that the comparison is strictly "less than". If you need to check for "less than or equal to", consider using a combination of the Math Less Than (Float) and Math Equal (Float) nodes.

## Common Issues

- If either input is not a valid floating-point number, the node may produce unexpected results or errors. Always ensure that the inputs are of the correct type.
- Be cautious when comparing floating-point numbers for equality, as rounding errors may cause slight differences in values. Consider using a small tolerance value when checking for equality.

By using the Math Less Than (Float) node, you can easily compare two floating-point numbers and make decisions based on the result, enabling you to create more dynamic and responsive spells in Magick.
