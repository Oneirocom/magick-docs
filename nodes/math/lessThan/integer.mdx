# Math Less Than (Integer)

The Math Less Than (Integer) node compares two integer values and outputs a boolean indicating whether the first value is less than the second.

## Inputs

1. `a` (integer, default: 0): The first value to compare.
2. `b` (integer, default: 0): The second value to compare.

## Outputs

1. `result` (boolean): True if `a` is less than `b`, false otherwise.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the Math Less Than (Integer) node:

1. Connect the integer values you want to compare to the `a` and `b` input ports. You can either link these from the outputs of other nodes or specify default values.
2. The node will output a boolean value to the `result` port, which will be true if `a` is less than `b`, and false otherwise.
3. You can then use this boolean output to control the flow of your spell, for example by connecting it to the condition port of a Flow If node.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that needs to perform different actions based on whether a user's age is below a certain threshold. You could use the Math Less Than (Integer) node like this:

1. Connect the user's age (assumed to be an integer) to the `a` port.
2. Set the default value of the `b` port to the age threshold, e.g., 18.
3. Connect the `result` port to a Flow If node's condition port.
4. Configure the Flow If node's "then" and "else" branches to perform the appropriate actions based on whether the user's age is below the threshold or not.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the values you connect to the `a` and `b` ports are actually integers. Connecting other data types may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Remember that this node performs a strict less than comparison. If you need to check for "less than or equal to", you should use the Math Less Than Or Equal (Integer) node instead.

## Common Issues

- If the node is not outputting the expected boolean value, double-check that you've connected the `a` and `b` inputs correctly and that they are both integers.
- Keep in mind that this node does not perform any type conversion. If you need to compare values that are not initially integers, you'll need to first convert them using a node like the Cast To Integer node.
