# Math Sqrt Float

The Math Sqrt Float node calculates the square root of a given floating-point number. It is useful when you need to find the square root of a value in your spell.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The input number for which to calculate the square root.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The square root of the input number.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a node that provides a floating-point number to the `a` input of the Math Sqrt Float node.
2. The node will calculate the square root of the input number and output the result through the `result` output.
3. Connect the `result` output to the input of another node to use the calculated square root value in your spell.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that needs to calculate the square root of a user-provided number. You can use the Math Sqrt Float node to achieve this:

1. Create an Input Number node to allow the user to enter a number.
2. Connect the output of the Input Number node to the `a` input of the Math Sqrt Float node.
3. Create a Debug Log node and connect the `result` output of the Math Sqrt Float node to the input of the Debug Log node.
4. When the spell is run, the user will be prompted to enter a number. The Math Sqrt Float node will calculate the square root of this number, and the result will be logged to the debug console.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the input to the Math Sqrt Float node is a non-negative number, as the square root of a negative number is undefined in the real number system.
- If you need to calculate the square root of a complex number or a matrix, consider using a more specialized library or custom code.

## Common Issues

- If the input to the Math Sqrt Float node is a negative number, the node will output `NaN` (Not a Number). Make sure to validate or constrain the input to non-negative numbers if necessary.
- Be aware of the precision limitations of floating-point numbers when working with very large or very small numbers.
