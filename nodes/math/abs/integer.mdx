# ABS (math/abs/integer)

The ABS (Absolute Value) node in Magick calculates the absolute value of an integer input. It returns the magnitude of the input number without regard to its sign.

## Inputs

- `a` (integer, default: 0): The input integer for which to calculate the absolute value.

## Outputs

- `result` (integer): The absolute value of the input integer.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect an integer value to the `a` input of the ABS node.
2. The node will output the absolute value of the input integer through its `result` output.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that calculates the difference between two numbers, but you always want the result to be a positive value. You can use the ABS node to ensure that the output is always positive, regardless of the order of the input numbers.

Here's an example of how you might use the ABS node in a spell:

```
Number (5) -> a |
                 Subtract -> difference | 
Number (7) -> b |                         ABS -> absolute_difference
```

In this example, the Subtract node calculates `5 - 7`, which results in `-2`. However, the ABS node then takes the absolute value of `-2`, resulting in a final output of `2`.

## Best Practices

- Use the ABS node whenever you need to ensure that a value is always positive, such as when calculating distances or magnitudes.
- Keep in mind that the ABS node only works with integers. If you need to calculate the absolute value of a floating-point number, you'll need to use a different node or first convert the input to an integer.

## Common Issues

- If the input to the ABS node is not an integer, the node will not function properly. Make sure to only connect integer values to the `a` input.
