# SIN (math/sin/float)

The SIN node calculates the sine of an input angle in radians and outputs the result as a float value between -1 and 1.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The input angle in radians.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The sine of the input angle.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the SIN node:

1. Connect a float value representing an angle in radians to the `a` input port.
2. The node will calculate the sine of the input angle and output the result via the `result` output port.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the SIN node in a spell:

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "type": "math/sin/float",
      "id": "sinNode",
      "inputs": {
        "a": 1.5707963267948966
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "io/output/float",
      "id": "outputNode",
      "inputs": {
        "value": "@sinNode.result"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

In this example:
1. The `sinNode` is a SIN node with its `a` input set to `1.5707963267948966` (π/2 radians, or 90 degrees).
2. The `outputNode` is connected to the `result` output of the `sinNode`.

When the spell is run, the SIN node will calculate the sine of π/2, which is approximately 1, and this value will be output by the `outputNode`.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the input angle is in radians. If your angle is in degrees, convert it to radians before connecting it to the SIN node.
- Keep in mind that the output of the SIN node will always be between -1 and 1, inclusive.

## Common Issues

- If the input angle is not in radians, the output will not be the expected value. Double-check that your input is in radians and convert from degrees if necessary.
- No output or unexpected output may indicate that the input port is not properly connected. Verify that the `a` input port is connected to a valid float value.
