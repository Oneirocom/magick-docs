# π (math/pi/float)

The π node (math/pi/float) provides the mathematical constant pi (π) as a floating-point number. Pi is a fundamental constant in mathematics, representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter. It is an irrational number, meaning it has an infinite number of decimal places without any repeating pattern.

## Inputs

This node has no inputs.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The value of pi as a floating-point number.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

To use the π node in your spell:

1. Add the π node to your graph.
2. Connect the `result` output to the input of another node that expects a floating-point number.

The π node will constantly output the value of pi, which can be used in mathematical calculations or any other operation that requires this constant.

## Example

Here's an example of how you might use the π node in a spell:

```
1. Add a π node to your graph.
2. Add a Number node and set its value to 5 (representing the radius of a circle).
3. Add a Multiplication node.
4. Connect the `result` output of the π node to the first input of the Multiplication node.
5. Connect the output of the Number node to the second input of the Multiplication node.
6. Add another Multiplication node.
7. Connect the output of the first Multiplication node to both inputs of the second Multiplication node.
8. The output of the second Multiplication node will be the area of the circle (π * radius^2).
```

This spell calculates the area of a circle with a radius of 5 units by multiplying pi by the square of the radius.

## Best Practices

- Use the π node whenever you need the value of pi in your calculations.
- Keep in mind that the π node outputs a floating-point approximation of pi, not the exact value (which would require infinite precision).

## Common Issues

There are no common issues specific to the π node, as it simply outputs a constant value. However, be aware of the limitations of floating-point precision when using this value in complex calculations.
