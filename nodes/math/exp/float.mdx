# EXP (Exponential)

The EXP node in Magick calculates the exponential function (e^x) for a given input value. It is a fundamental mathematical operation used in various scenarios, such as modeling growth, decay, or scaling values exponentially.

## Inputs

- `a` (float, default: 0): The input value for which to calculate the exponential function.

## Outputs

- `result` (float): The exponential function value (e^a) for the given input.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a node that provides a float value to the `a` input of the EXP node.
2. The EXP node will calculate the exponential function value (e^a) for the given input.
3. The result will be available at the `result` output, which can be connected to other nodes for further processing.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the EXP node in a Magick spell:

```
1. Create a Float node and set its value to 2.
2. Connect the Float node to the `a` input of the EXP node.
3. Connect the `result` output of the EXP node to a Display node.
4. Run the spell.
```

The Display node will show the result of e^2, which is approximately 7.3891.

## Best Practices

- Be aware of the input range, as the exponential function can quickly produce very large values for relatively small inputs.
- If you need to calculate the natural logarithm (the inverse of the exponential function), use the LOG node instead.

## Common Issues

- Make sure the input value is of the correct type (float). Connecting a non-float value may lead to unexpected results or errors.
- Keep in mind that the exponential function grows rapidly, so be cautious when using large input values, as they may cause overflow or exceed the desired range.

By using the EXP node in Magick, you can easily incorporate exponential scaling or growth into your spells, enabling you to create more complex and dynamic visual programming workflows.
