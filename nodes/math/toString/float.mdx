# To String (Float)

The To String (Float) node in Magick converts a floating-point number to its string representation. This node is useful when you need to display or log a float value as text, or when working with nodes that expect string inputs.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The floating-point number to be converted to a string.

## Outputs

1. `result` (string): The string representation of the input floating-point number.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the To String (Float) node:

1. Add the To String (Float) node to your spell.
2. Connect the floating-point number you want to convert to the `a` input of the node.
3. The `result` output will provide the string representation of the input number, which you can then connect to other nodes as needed.

## Example

Here's a simple example demonstrating how to use the To String (Float) node in a Magick spell:

1. Create a new spell and add a Constant node. Set its value to a floating-point number, e.g., 3.14159.
2. Add a To String (Float) node to the spell and connect the output of the Constant node to the `a` input of the To String (Float) node.
3. Add a Debug Print node and connect the `result` output of the To String (Float) node to the input of the Debug Print node.
4. Run the spell. The Debug Print node will output the string representation of the floating-point number, in this case, "3.14159".

## Best Practices and Tips

- Use the To String (Float) node whenever you need to convert a floating-point number to a string for display, logging, or compatibility with other nodes that expect string inputs.
- Keep in mind that the string representation of a float may vary depending on the number of decimal places and the specific floating-point value.

## Common Issues

There are no common issues or gotchas specific to the To String (Float) node. As long as you provide a valid floating-point number as input, the node will function as expected.
