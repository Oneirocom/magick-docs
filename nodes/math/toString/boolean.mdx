# To String (Boolean)

The To String (Boolean) node in Magick converts a boolean value (`true` or `false`) into its string representation.

## Inputs

- `a` (boolean): The boolean value to be converted to a string. Default value is `false`.

## Outputs

- `result` (string): The string representation of the input boolean value.

## Configuration

This node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect a node that outputs a boolean value (such as a comparison node or a boolean constant node) to the `a` input of the To String (Boolean) node.
2. The `result` output will contain the string representation of the input boolean value, either `"true"` or `"false"`.

## Example

Suppose you have a spell that checks if a number is greater than 10 and you want to display the result as a string. You can use the To String (Boolean) node to convert the boolean output of the comparison node to a string.

1. Connect a Number node to the `a` input of a Greater Than node.
2. Set the `b` input of the Greater Than node to `10`.
3. Connect the `result` output of the Greater Than node to the `a` input of the To String (Boolean) node.
4. Connect the `result` output of the To String (Boolean) node to a Display Alert node to show the string representation of the comparison result.

Now, when the spell is run, it will display "true" if the input number is greater than 10, or "false" otherwise.

## Best Practices

- Use the To String (Boolean) node when you need to convert a boolean value to a string for display purposes or for concatenating with other strings.
- Keep in mind that the output will always be lowercase ("true" or "false").

## Common Issues

There are no common issues or gotchas associated with the To String (Boolean) node, as it performs a straightforward conversion from boolean to string.
