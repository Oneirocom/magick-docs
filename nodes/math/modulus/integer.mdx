# MOD (math/modulus/integer)

The MOD node calculates the modulus (remainder) of dividing two integers. It returns the remainder that results from dividing the first input integer by the second input integer.

## Inputs

1. `a` (integer, default: 0): The dividend, or the number to be divided.
2. `b` (integer, default: 0): The divisor, or the number to divide by.

## Outputs

1. `result` (integer): The remainder after dividing `a` by `b`.

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect an integer value to the `a` input to specify the dividend.
2. Connect an integer value to the `b` input to specify the divisor.
3. The node will output the remainder of dividing `a` by `b` via the `result` output.

## Example

Let's say you have a spell that needs to determine if a given number is odd or even. You can use the MOD node to check if the number is divisible by 2.

1. Connect the integer you want to check to the `a` input of the MOD node.
2. Connect the integer 2 to the `b` input of the MOD node.
3. If the `result` output is 0, the input number is even. If the `result` is 1, the input number is odd.

Here's what the spell might look like:

```
Number to Check -> [MOD].a
                      |
          2 ----> [MOD].b
                      |
                   [MOD].result -- 0 --> Even
                                 \- 1 --> Odd
```

## Best Practices

- Make sure to handle the case where `b` is 0, as dividing by zero is undefined. You may want to add a check before the MOD node to handle this case gracefully.
- Keep in mind that the result of the modulo operation will always have the same sign as the divisor (`b`). 

## Common Issues

- If the `b` input is 0, the node will throw an error as division by zero is not allowed. Always ensure that `b` is not 0 before using this node.
- Be careful when using negative numbers, as the behavior of the modulo operator can be unintuitive. In Magick, `a % b` always returns a value with the same sign as `b`.
