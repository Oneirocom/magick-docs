# MIX (math/mix/float)

The MIX node performs a linear interpolation between two float values based on a third float value. It allows you to smoothly blend between two numbers by specifying a mix factor.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The first value to interpolate between.
2. `b` (float, default: 0): The second value to interpolate between.
3. `c` (float, default: 0): The mix factor that determines the interpolation amount. A value of 0 returns `a`, a value of 1 returns `b`, and values in between return a linear blend of `a` and `b`.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The interpolated value between `a` and `b` based on the mix factor `c`.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the MIX node:

1. Connect the first value you want to interpolate between to the `a` input.
2. Connect the second value you want to interpolate between to the `b` input.
3. Connect a value between 0 and 1 to the `c` input to control the interpolation amount.
4. The interpolated result will be available at the `result` output.

## Example

Here's an example of how you might use the MIX node in a spell:

```
input1 [Slider] (min: 0, max: 100, default: 25)
input2 [Slider] (min: 0, max: 100, default: 75) 
mixFactor [Slider] (min: 0, max: 1, step: 0.01, default: 0.5)

mix [MIX]
  a = input1
  b = input2
  c = mixFactor

output [Debug]
  value = mix.result
```

In this example:
- `input1` and `input2` are two sliders that provide the values to interpolate between. 
- `mixFactor` is a slider that controls the interpolation amount.
- The MIX node interpolates between `input1` and `input2` based on `mixFactor`.
- The interpolated result is displayed using a Debug node.

## Best Practices

- Ensure the `c` input is always between 0 and 1. Values outside this range will be clamped.
- MIX is useful for creating smooth transitions, fades, and blends between two values.
- You can chain multiple MIX nodes together to interpolate between more than two values.

## Common Issues

- If the interpolated result is not what you expect, double check that the `c` input is between 0 and 1.
- Be aware that the MIX node does a simple linear interpolation. For other types of interpolation, like easing functions, you'll need to use different math nodes.
