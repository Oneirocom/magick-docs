# COS (math/cos/float)

The COS node calculates the cosine of an angle given in radians. It is a fundamental trigonometric function commonly used in mathematical expressions and graphics programming.

## Inputs

1. `a` (float, default: 0): The input angle in radians.

## Outputs

1. `result` (float): The cosine of the input angle.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the COS node:

1. Connect a float value representing an angle in radians to the `a` input port.
2. The node will calculate the cosine of the input angle and output the result via the `result` output port.
3. Connect the `result` output to the desired destination node(s) in your spell.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the COS node in a Magick spell:

```
1. Create a Float node and set its value to `PI / 4` (45 degrees in radians).
2. Connect the Float node's output to the `a` input port of the COS node.
3. Create a Debug Print node and connect the `result` output of the COS node to its input.
4. Run the spell.
```

The Debug Print node will output the cosine of 45 degrees, which is approximately 0.7071.

## Tips

- Remember that the input angle must be in radians, not degrees. To convert degrees to radians, multiply the angle in degrees by `PI / 180`.
- The cosine function is periodic with a period of 2π radians. This means that `cos(a) = cos(a + 2π)` for any angle `a`.
- The cosine of 0 is always 1, and the cosine of π/2 (90 degrees) is always 0.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the input angle is in radians. If the result seems incorrect, double-check that you are not accidentally providing the angle in degrees.
- Be aware of the floating-point precision limitations in computer arithmetic. For very large or very small angles, the result may not be exact due to rounding errors.
