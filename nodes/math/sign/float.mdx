# SIGN

The SIGN node in Magick is a utility node that determines the sign of a floating-point number. It takes a single input value and outputs a value indicating whether the input is positive, negative, or zero.

## Inputs

- `a` (float): The input value for which to determine the sign. Default value is 0.

## Outputs

- `result` (float): The sign of the input value. Possible values are:
  - 1.0 if the input is positive
  - -1.0 if the input is negative
  - 0.0 if the input is zero

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

To use the SIGN node:

1. Connect the floating-point value you want to analyze to the `a` input.
2. The `result` output will emit 1.0, -1.0, or 0.0 depending on the sign of the input value.

## Example

Here's an example of how the SIGN node can be used in a Magick spell:

```
// ... (other nodes)
SIGN(
  a: NUMBER(3.14)
)
// SIGN will output 1.0 since 3.14 is positive
// ... (other nodes)
```

In this example, the SIGN node is used to determine the sign of the constant value 3.14. Since 3.14 is positive, the SIGN node will output 1.0.

## Best Practices

- Use SIGN when you need to make decisions or route values based on whether a number is positive, negative or zero.
- Remember that SIGN treats 0.0 as a special case, distinct from positive and negative numbers.

## Gotchas

- SIGN only works with floating-point numbers. If you need to determine the sign of an integer, first convert it to a float.
- Be careful not to confuse the output of 0.0 (indicating a zero input) with a false or null value. The output is still a float.
