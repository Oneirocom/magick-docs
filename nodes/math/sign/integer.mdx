# SIGN

The SIGN node is a utility node that determines the sign of an integer input. It outputs an integer value indicating whether the input is positive, negative, or zero.

## Inputs

- `a` (integer, default: 0): The input integer value to determine the sign of.

## Outputs

- `result` (integer): An integer value representing the sign of the input:
  - 1 if the input is positive
  - -1 if the input is negative
  - 0 if the input is zero

## Configuration

This node has no configuration options.

## Usage

To use the SIGN node, simply connect an integer value to its `a` input. The node will output an integer indicating the sign of the input value.

This node is useful in situations where you need to make decisions or perform different actions based on whether a value is positive, negative, or zero. For example, you might use the SIGN node to control the direction of movement in a game or simulation, or to determine which branch of a conditional flow to take.

## Example

Here's a simple example spell that uses the SIGN node to determine the sign of a random integer and display a corresponding message:

```
1. Create a Random Integer node and configure its range (e.g., -10 to 10).
2. Connect the output of the Random Integer node to the `a` input of a SIGN node.
3. Create a Switch node and connect the `result` output of the SIGN node to its `input` port.
4. Configure the Switch node with three cases:
   - Case 1: value 1, output "The number is positive!"
   - Case 2: value -1, output "The number is negative!"
   - Case 3: value 0, output "The number is zero!"
5. Connect the output of the Switch node to a Debug Print node.
```

When this spell is run, it will generate a random integer, determine its sign using the SIGN node, and then display a message indicating whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.

## Best Practices

- Make sure to connect an integer value to the `a` input of the SIGN node. Connecting other data types may lead to unexpected behavior.
- Use the SIGN node in combination with other nodes, such as Switch or Condition nodes, to make decisions based on the sign of a value.

## Common Issues

There are no common issues or gotchas to watch out for with the SIGN node, as it has a straightforward purpose and no configuration options. However, ensure that you are connecting an integer value to its input to avoid any type mismatch issues.
