# Send Slack Audio

The Send Slack Audio node allows you to send an audio file to a Slack channel or direct message within a Magick spell. This node is useful when you want to share audio content, such as voice messages, music clips, or sound effects, with your Slack workspace.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The input flow from the previous node in the spell.
- `audioFile` (required): The audio file to be sent to Slack, provided as a buffer.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The output flow to be passed to the next node in the spell.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the `flow` output from the previous node to the `flow` input of the Send Slack Audio node.
2. Connect the `audioFile` output from a node that provides an audio buffer (e.g., a Load Audio File node) to the `audioFile` input of the Send Slack Audio node.
3. Configure your Slack API token and channel/user ID in the Magick app settings.
4. Run the spell, and the audio file will be sent to the specified Slack channel or direct message.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Send Slack Audio node in a Magick spell:

1. Use a Load Audio File node to load an audio file from your local machine or a URL.
2. Connect the `buffer` output of the Load Audio File node to the `audioFile` input of the Send Slack Audio node.
3. Connect the `flow` output of the previous node (e.g., a trigger node) to the `flow` input of the Send Slack Audio node.
4. Configure your Slack API token and target channel/user ID in the Magick app settings.
5. Run the spell, and the audio file will be sent to the specified Slack channel or direct message.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the audio file is in a format supported by Slack (e.g., MP3, WAV, M4A, or OGG).
- Be mindful of the audio file size, as Slack has a size limit for file uploads. If the file is too large, consider compressing it or using a different file format.
- Double-check your Slack API token and target channel/user ID to avoid sending the audio file to the wrong place.

## Common Issues

- If the audio file fails to send, verify that your Slack API token is valid and has the necessary permissions to send files.
- Make sure the `audioFile` input is properly connected to a node that provides an audio buffer. The Send Slack Audio node will not work with file paths or URLs directly.

By using the Send Slack Audio node, you can easily incorporate audio content into your Slack communications, enhancing collaboration and engagement within your Magick spells.
