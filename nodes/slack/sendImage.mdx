# Send Slack Image

The Send Slack Image node allows you to send one or more images to a Slack channel within a Magick flow. This node is useful when you want to share visual content, such as charts, graphs, photos, or screenshots, with your Slack team as part of an automated workflow.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The incoming flow from the previous node.
- `images` (required): An array of image URLs or base64-encoded image data to send to Slack.
- `comment` (optional): A text comment to include with the images. Default is an empty string.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The outgoing flow to the next node, if any.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add the Send Slack Image node to your spell.
2. Connect the `flow` input to the output of the previous node.
3. Provide an array of image URLs or base64-encoded image data to the `images` input. You can use the Array node to construct this input.
4. (Optional) Provide a text comment to include with the images using the `comment` input.
5. Connect the `flow` output to the next node in your spell, if desired.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Send Slack Image node in a spell:

1. Use an HTTP Request node to fetch data from an API.
2. Process the API response using a Transform JSON node to extract relevant image URLs.
3. Connect the extracted image URLs to the `images` input of the Send Slack Image node.
4. Set the `comment` input to "Check out these latest charts!".
5. The Send Slack Image node will send the specified images to your configured Slack channel, along with the comment.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that the image URLs are publicly accessible or that the base64-encoded image data is valid.
- Be mindful of the size and number of images you send to avoid cluttering the Slack channel.
- Provide a meaningful comment to give context to the images you're sharing.

## Common Issues

- If the images fail to send, double-check that the image URLs are correct and accessible, or that the base64-encoded image data is properly formatted.
- Make sure you have correctly configured your Slack integration in the Magick platform settings.
