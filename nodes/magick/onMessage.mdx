# On Message

The On Message node is an event node that triggers when a new message is received in a connected chat or messaging system. It allows you to capture and process incoming messages, enabling the creation of interactive conversational experiences.

## Inputs

This node has no inputs.

## Outputs

- `flow` (flow): The flow output allows you to chain additional nodes to handle the message event.
- `content` (string): The content of the received message as a string value.
- `event` (object): The complete event object containing metadata about the received message.

## Configuration

- `hiddenProperties` (array, default: `["hiddenProperties", "eventState"]`): Specifies the properties to be hidden from the event object in the node's UI.
- `eventState` (array, default: `[]`): Defines the event state properties to be stored and passed to subsequent nodes.
- `eventStateProperties` (array, default: `["connector", "client", "channel", "agentId", "sender"]`): Specifies the properties to be included in the event state.

## Usage

1. Add an On Message node to your spell.
2. Connect the node to a chat or messaging system using the appropriate connector node (e.g., Slack Connector, Discord Connector).
3. Configure the node by specifying the desired event state properties and any properties you want to hide from the UI.
4. Connect the `flow` output to other nodes to process the received message and perform desired actions.
5. Deploy your spell and start receiving and handling incoming messages.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the On Message node in a spell:

```markdown
1. Slack Connector
2. On Message
   - eventStateProperties: ["channel", "sender"]
3. If
   - condition: `{{content}} == "hello"`
4. Send Message
   - channel: `{{event.channel}}`
   - message: "Hello, {{event.sender}}! How can I assist you today?"
5. End If
```

In this example:
1. The Slack Connector node establishes a connection to a Slack workspace.
2. The On Message node is triggered whenever a new message is received in the connected Slack channel.
3. The If node checks if the received message content is equal to "hello".
4. If the condition is true, the Send Message node sends a personalized response back to the same Slack channel, addressing the sender by name.
5. The End If node marks the end of the conditional block.

## Best Practices

- Use the On Message node to create interactive conversational experiences by responding to user messages.
- Customize the event state properties to include only the necessary information for your use case.
- Chain additional nodes after the On Message node to process the message content and perform desired actions.
- Handle different message patterns or commands using conditional nodes (e.g., If, Switch) to create branching conversation flows.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the connected chat or messaging system is properly authenticated and has the necessary permissions to receive messages.
- Be mindful of the rate limits and usage restrictions imposed by the messaging platform to avoid exceeding them.
- Handle potential errors gracefully and provide appropriate fallback responses to maintain a smooth user experience.

By leveraging the On Message node, you can create engaging conversational experiences and build interactive chatbots or messaging applications with Magick.
