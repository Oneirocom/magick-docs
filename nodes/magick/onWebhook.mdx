# On Webhook

The On Webhook node is an event node that triggers a spell when a webhook event is received. It allows you to create reactive spells that respond to external events from other systems or services.

## Inputs

This node has no inputs.

## Outputs

- `flow`: Triggers the next node in the spell when a webhook event is received.
- `content`: The content of the webhook event, typically the payload data sent by the external system.
- `callback`: A callback URL that can be used to send a response back to the external system.
- `event`: The full webhook event object, which contains metadata about the event.

## Configuration

- `hiddenProperties`: An array of property names that should be hidden from the event object. Defaults to `["hiddenProperties", "eventState"]`.
- `eventState`: An array representing the current state of the event. Defaults to an empty array.
- `eventStateProperties`: An array of property names that should be included in the event state. Defaults to `["connector", "client", "channel", "agentId", "sender"]`.

## Usage

1. Add an On Webhook node to your spell.
2. Configure any desired hidden properties, event state, or event state properties in the node's configuration.
3. Connect the node's `flow` output to the next node in your spell that should be triggered when a webhook event is received.
4. Use the `content`, `callback`, and `event` outputs to access the webhook payload data, callback URL, and full event object in your spell.
5. Deploy your spell and configure the external system to send webhook events to the provided URL.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the On Webhook node in a spell:

```
1. On Webhook
   |
2. Code
   - Print the content of the webhook payload
   - Print the full event object
   |
3. HTTP Request
   - URL: (use the callback from On Webhook)
   - Method: POST
   - Body: "Webhook received successfully"
```

In this example:
1. The On Webhook node triggers the spell when a webhook event is received.
2. The Code node prints the content of the webhook payload and the full event object to the console for debugging.
3. The HTTP Request node sends a response back to the external system using the callback URL from the On Webhook node.

## Best Practices

- Secure your webhook endpoints by using authentication tokens or signatures to verify that events are coming from trusted sources.
- Validate and sanitize the incoming webhook data to ensure it matches the expected format and doesn't contain any malicious content.
- Use the `hiddenProperties` configuration to exclude sensitive data from the event object if needed.
- Keep your webhook handling logic concise and efficient to avoid blocking the event loop and causing delays for other events.

## Gotchas

- Make sure your spell is deployed and accessible from the internet so external systems can send webhook events to it.
- Be aware of rate limits and potential high-traffic scenarios that could overwhelm your spell. Implement throttling or queuing mechanisms if needed.
- If your spell modifies the `eventState`, ensure that you handle potential race conditions and conflicts if multiple events are processed concurrently.
