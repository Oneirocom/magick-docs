# Query Knowledge

The Query Knowledge node allows you to retrieve information from a knowledge base within a Magick flow. It provides a flexible way to access stored knowledge and integrate it into your spells.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The input flow containing the data to be processed.
- `query` (optional): The query string used to search the knowledge base. If left empty, the node will return all available knowledge.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The output flow with the retrieved knowledge added.
- `knowledge`: The knowledge retrieved from the knowledge base based on the provided query.

## Configuration

This node does not have any additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the input flow to the `flow` input port of the Query Knowledge node.
2. Optionally, provide a query string in the `query` input field to search for specific knowledge. Leave it empty to retrieve all knowledge.
3. Connect the `flow` output port to the next node in your spell to continue processing the flow with the retrieved knowledge.
4. Use the `knowledge` output port to access the retrieved knowledge in subsequent nodes or for further processing.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the Query Knowledge node in a Magick spell:

```markdown
1. Start (Trigger) 
2. Query Knowledge
   - query: "magick best practices"
3. Generate Text 
   - prompt: "Summarize the following knowledge: {{knowledge}}"
4. Send Email
   - to: "user@example.com"
   - subject: "Magick Best Practices"
   - body: "{{text}}"
```

In this example, the Query Knowledge node is used to retrieve knowledge related to "magick best practices" from the knowledge base. The retrieved knowledge is then passed to a Generate Text node, which summarizes the knowledge. Finally, the summarized text is sent as an email using the Send Email node.

## Best Practices

- Be specific with your query to retrieve the most relevant knowledge.
- If you want to retrieve all available knowledge, leave the `query` input empty.
- Use the retrieved knowledge in combination with other nodes to create powerful and dynamic spells.

## Common Issues

- If the `query` input is too broad or ambiguous, the node may return a large amount of knowledge, which can impact performance.
- Ensure that the knowledge base contains relevant and up-to-date information for accurate results.

By leveraging the Query Knowledge node, you can easily access and integrate stored knowledge into your Magick spells, enabling more intelligent and context-aware processing.
