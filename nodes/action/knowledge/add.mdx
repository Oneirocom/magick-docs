# Add Knowledge

The Add Knowledge node allows you to add knowledge to your Magick flow from a variety of data sources. This node is a fundamental building block for working with knowledge in Magick.

## Inputs

- `flow` (required): The input flow to which the knowledge will be added.
- `knowledge` (required): The knowledge content to be added, in string format. 
- `dataType` (optional, default: "auto"): The type of the knowledge data. Can be one of:
  - "auto" (default): Automatically detect the data type
  - "text": Plain text 
  - "youtube_video": A YouTube video
  - "pdf_file": A PDF file
  - "web_page": A web page
  - "sitemap": A sitemap
  - "xml": An XML file
  - "docx": A Microsoft Word document
  - "docs_site": A documentation site
  - "notion": A Notion page
  - "csv": A CSV file
  - "mdx": An MDX file
  - "qna_pair": A question-answer pair
  - "image": An image file
  - "unstructured": Unstructured data
  - "json": A JSON file
  - "openapi": An OpenAPI specification
  - "gmail": A Gmail message
  - "substack": A Substack post
  - "youtube_channel": A YouTube channel
  - "discord": A Discord message
  - "custom": Custom data type
  - "rss_feed": An RSS feed
  - "beehiiv": A Beehiiv post
  - "google_drive": A Google Drive file
  - "directory": A directory
  - "slack": A Slack message
  - "dropbox": A Dropbox file
  - "text_file": A text file

## Outputs

- `flow`: The output flow with the added knowledge.

## Configuration

This node has no additional configuration options.

## Usage

1. Connect the input flow to the `flow` input of the Add Knowledge node.
2. Provide the knowledge content you want to add in the `knowledge` input. This should be a string.
3. (Optional) Select the appropriate `dataType` for your knowledge if it is not automatically detected correctly. 
4. Connect the `flow` output to the next node in your spell.

## Example 

Here's an example of using the Add Knowledge node to add some text to a flow:

```
// Create a new flow
CREATE flow

// Add some knowledge
ADD knowledge 
  flow = flow
  knowledge = "Magick is a powerful tool for building AI apps."

// Use the knowledge in a spell
GET flow
TRANSFORM flow
  prompt = "Summarize this: {{flow}}"
SEND message
  content = "{{flow.summary}}"
```

In this example, we create a new flow, add a piece of text knowledge to it using the Add Knowledge node, and then use that knowledge in a spell to generate a summary and send it as a message.

## Best Practices

- Make sure to provide valid, well-formatted data in the `knowledge` input that matches the selected `dataType`.
- If the automatic data type detection is not working as expected, explicitly set the `dataType` to ensure correct processing.
- Be mindful of the size of the knowledge you are adding. Very large data could impact performance.

## Common Issues

- If the knowledge is not being added correctly, double check that the `knowledge` input is a valid string and the `dataType` is set appropriately.
- Some data types may require additional processing or setup (e.g. authenticating to access a Google Drive file). Make sure you have completed any necessary prerequisites.
