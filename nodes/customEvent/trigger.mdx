# Trigger

The Trigger node is a fundamental component in Magick that allows you to initiate a spell based on a custom event. It acts as the starting point for your spell, waiting for a specific event to occur before triggering the execution of the connected nodes.

## Inputs

- `flow`: The input flow port that allows the Trigger node to be connected to other nodes in the spell.

## Outputs

- `flow`: The output flow port that is activated when the specified custom event is triggered, allowing the execution to continue to the next connected node.

## Configuration

- `customEventId` (string, default: "-1"): The unique identifier of the custom event that the Trigger node should listen for. This ID should match the event you want to trigger the spell.

## Usage

1. Drag and drop the Trigger node onto the canvas.
2. Connect the `flow` output port of the Trigger node to the input port of the next node in your spell.
3. In the configuration panel of the Trigger node, set the `customEventId` to the ID of the custom event you want to listen for.
4. Deploy your spell.
5. When the specified custom event is triggered, the Trigger node will activate, and the execution will continue to the next connected node in the spell.

## Example

Let's say you have a spell that sends a notification when a specific custom event is triggered. Here's how you can use the Trigger node to start the spell:

1. Create a new spell and add a Trigger node to the canvas.
2. Connect the `flow` output of the Trigger node to the input of a Notification node.
3. Configure the Trigger node by setting the `customEventId` to the ID of the custom event you want to listen for (e.g., "myCustomEvent").
4. Configure the Notification node with the desired notification settings.
5. Deploy the spell.

Now, whenever the custom event with the specified ID is triggered, the Trigger node will activate, and the Notification node will send the configured notification.

## Best Practices

- Choose a unique and descriptive `customEventId` to avoid conflicts with other custom events in your system.
- Keep your spells focused and modular by using separate Trigger nodes for different custom events, rather than trying to handle multiple events in a single spell.

## Common Issues

- Make sure the `customEventId` in the Trigger node configuration matches exactly with the ID of the custom event you want to listen for. Any mismatch will prevent the spell from triggering.
- If your spell is not triggering as expected, double-check that the custom event is being properly triggered in your system and that the event ID is correct.

By using the Trigger node, you can create powerful and responsive spells that react to specific custom events in your application or system.
