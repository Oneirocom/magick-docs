# On End

The On End node is a lifecycle event node that triggers when a spell has finished executing. It is useful for performing cleanup tasks, logging final results, or triggering other actions that should occur after a spell has completed.

## Inputs

The On End node does not have any inputs.

## Outputs

- `flow` (flow): The output flow that is triggered when the spell ends. Connect this to other nodes to perform actions after the spell finishes.

## Configuration

The On End node does not have any configuration options.

## Usage

1. Add an On End node to your spell.
2. Connect the `flow` output to other nodes that should be executed when the spell finishes.
3. The connected nodes will be triggered automatically when the spell execution reaches its end.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the On End node in a spell:

```
1. Start Spell
2. (Your main spell logic goes here)
3. On End
4. Log Message ("Spell execution completed.")
```

In this example, the On End node is placed after the main spell logic. When the spell finishes executing, the On End node triggers and sends a flow to the connected Log Message node, which logs "Spell execution completed."

## Best Practices

- Use the On End node to perform any necessary cleanup tasks, such as closing database connections, releasing resources, or resetting variables.
- Log important information or final results using the On End node for easier debugging and monitoring.
- Keep the actions triggered by the On End node lightweight and quick to execute, as they will delay the final completion of the spell.

## Common Issues

- Ensure that the nodes connected to the On End node do not have any long-running or blocking operations, as this can prevent the spell from finishing promptly.
- Be cautious when using the On End node to trigger other spells or external services, as it may lead to unexpected behavior or infinite loops if not designed properly.

By using the On End node, you can easily add actions that should be performed when a spell finishes executing, making your spells more organized, maintainable, and efficient.
